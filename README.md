# async-test - A Dining Philosophers solver

The efforts of the [Amsterdam meetup](http://amsclj.nl) to learn how to use [`core.async`](https://github.com/clojure/core.async/) are gathered here.

## Usage

We use [`midje`](https://github.com/marick/Midje) `autotest` to monitor our tests, and add code in a pure TDD fashion. Being a self learning group activity the resulting code is more geared towards prooving some points rather than being efficient and whatnot.

Currently, we are still quite far away from having a working Dining Philosopher solver. Stay tuned for updates!
